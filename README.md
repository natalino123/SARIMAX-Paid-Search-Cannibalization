# SARIMAX-Paid-Search-Cannibalization
Determine if the increase of Paid Search traffic is cannibalizing the Organic Search traffic for a website.

We would like to know what the trend of Organic Search would have been if it were not for the supposed cannibalization from the increased paid search. By forecasting what the Organic Search wouldâ€™ve been, we can quantify the effect of introducing more Paid Search. We can therefore conclude whether increased Paid Search has increased the ROI or decreased it, and subsequently, can assess whether an adjustment to our channel expenditure is necessary.
